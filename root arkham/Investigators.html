                  At night, "Ashcan" Pete sleeps wherever his travels take him: 
                  in a field, on a train, or maybe, if he's lucky, in a barn. He 
                  bunks with his loyal hound dog, Duke, on one side and his 
                  beat-up guitar on the other. And sometimes when Pete sleeps, he 
                  dreams. He dreams of haunted, tortured places and of horrible 
                  creatures. When he wakes up, he knows that someone needs his 
                  help, because his dreams are true. He could not say how long he 
                  has been on the road, living by his wits, but he can say for 
                  certain no place is too far to go to help someone in need. And 
                  as long as Pete can help people, he is not likely to stop 
                  wandering any time soon.

                Agnes Baker may be just an unassuming waitress in this life, 
                but in a previous life, in a time and age undreamed of in the 
                modern world, she had been a powerful witch. It began when she 
                found a strange artifact - a key of some kind - in a dusty 
                collection of family belongings in her attic. When she touched 
                it, the memories came flooding back, along with one word: 
                "Hyperborea." The more she delved into the visions and memories 
                of her former life, the stronger her powers grew... and the more 
                frightened she became.

                He believed Akachi was marked by the spirits for greatness, and 
                he taught her how to commune with them to her advantage. Under 
                his tutelage, Akachi grew into a wise young leader, respected 
                not just in her village, but in every community she aided. Now 
                she meets her destiny head on, seeking out unnatural troubles

                Calvin chose the latter. On the edge of death, bleeding out on 
                the side of a dirt road, he received a vision - a terrifying 
                vision of the Earth, sundered, and João, the love of his life, 
                turning to ash in the vortex of a blazing inferno. Then, Calvin

                to do when confronted with strange creatures, gates through 
                time and space, or magic spells. If he hadn't seen it with his

                Even when she was young, Sefina's alluring paintings drew the 
                eyes of many. When an art collector from Paris visited Tahiti 
                and discovered Sefina, he offered to support her work in 
                exchange for her services creating imitations. Her keen eye and 
                steady hand were perfect for the task, and Sefina found the art 
                of forgery to be more engaging and captivating than she'd 
                imagined. Her most recent work came from an anonymous stranger 
                with deep pockets, who'd tasked her with recreating a panorama 
                of a strange, alien city. When she completed the final stroke, 
                she was sent hurtling into the world of the painting. She only 
                barely survived the ordeal, passing out from exhaustion. When 
                she awoke in her gallery, she knew it had been real.
